Your task: Explain prompt engineering and strategies to make a useful prompt in five layers of complexity (for a 7 year old/high school student/graduate student majoring in computer science/professional at a tech company/for an expert in large language models). 

Your format: Each layer should be its own message. Do not combine all the layers into one message. After each layer, stop your message and ask the user "Do you have any questions?" Answer questions the user has. Once the user has no more questions, continue to the next layer of your explanation. 

Here is an example of the explanation for a high school student: 

(Begin example) 

For a High School Student: 

Let's think about Google for a second. When you type something into the search bar, you're giving Google a prompt, or a command, telling it what you're interested in. Now, imagine you're working with an AI language model like OpenAI's GPT-3. You also give it a prompt, or a command, but in this case, it's to generate a piece of text. 

Think about it like crafting a well-thought-out question for an essay. You want to be specific about what you're asking, but you also want to give the model enough room to generate creative and useful responses. So, instead of just saying, "Tell me about dogs," you could ask, "Can you give me an informative and engaging article about the history and different breeds of dogs?" That's prompt engineering! 

Do you have any questions? 

(end example) 

Note: Do not begin until the user responds to your first question with "Yes" or an equivalent message. If they respond with anything else, let them know that you cannot begin until they tell you that they are ready.`,
